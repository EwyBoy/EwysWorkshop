Author's note:

As a mod author it is sad to see a mod die. Especially the mods you love playing with.  The original mod have't got any updates since Sep 10, 2014 and lacked full compatibility with 1.7.10 with semi outdated code. I have now updated the mod to fully support 1.7.10 and overhauled a big chunk of the code up to my standards. I also added Waila support and better a NEI integration. Some values from the original mod has been tweaked. Those values are also now configurable in the mods config file generated on launch. RF support is also on its way to the mod and expect new upgrades. This is not meant to disrespect the original author Vswe but instead as a tribute to his awesome work.

 

About the mod:

Either you wanna have 4 crafting grids in one table to work on complex recipes or run 4 furnaces in the space of one block powered by one internal fuel source. Or maybe you wanna mix em up like this:
